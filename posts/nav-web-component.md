Recently I've been trying to learn vanilla web development. I started out fully immersing myself in React and while at SELISE I was working with Angular.

And it has left me with this sense of being better at a framework rather than being good at JavaScript & HTML. Which makes me feel like I have an unstable foundation.

So I've turned to going back to the fundamentals. I've been working through [33 JavaScript Concepts](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts) and thought that I needed a documenting process not just for branding and marketing but also to learn better and remember more.

And then I thought, well I already have this personal site in plain `HTML` and `CSS`, why don't I try making a low effort, low quality and informal blog on that site.

I set up a personal challenge for this blog and that is to not use any frameworks: no React, no Preact, and not even lit. I considered using lit but then I was again going back to the loop of being a framework first person.

Well thats it for the motive behind this blog and also what tech-stack its using. Its pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Along with this I am using this thing called *md-block* which renders markdown in html. This is so that I dont have to spend so much time when I write something.

## WebComponents: A rundown

I wanted to use web-components since I'd heard of it a lot and because it was also a native way to write components.

The biggest pain point of going vanilla `HTML` for me is the copy pasting that I need to do. For example initially the nav bar for this was copy pasted for the 2 pages I had. 

```js
foo();
HelloWorld();

const test = "third"
```
