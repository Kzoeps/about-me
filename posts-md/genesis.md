Recently I've been trying to learn vanilla web development. I started out fully immersing myself in React and while at SELISE I was working with Angular.

And it has left me with this sense of being better at a framework rather than being good at JavaScript & HTML. Which makes me feel like I have an unstable foundation.

So I've turned to going back to the fundamentals. I've been working through [33 JavaScript Concepts](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts) and thought that I needed a documenting process not just for branding and marketing but also to learn better and remember more.

And then I thought, well I already have this personal site in plain `HTML` and `CSS`, why don't I try making a low effort, low quality and informal blog on that site.

I set a personal challenge for this website: to not use any frameworks, no React, no Preact, and not even lit. I considered using lit but then I was again going back to the loop of being a framework first person.

Well thats it for the motive behind this collection and also what tech-stack its using. Its pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Along with this I am using this thing called *md-block* which renders markdown in html. This is so that I dont have to spend so much time when I write something.

Currently the posts portion of this looks a bit messy with a lot of duplication. But I think I'll think of how to build a CMS like thing once I have enough posts to worry about too much duplication.

For now though, Im going to work through this slowly. I also want to create a RSS feed and an email subscription so that anyone can subscribe to it.

Yeah this is going to be like zero edits, full raw.
